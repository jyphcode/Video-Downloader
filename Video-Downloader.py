# Simple Video Downloader
# Author: JYPH
# Date: 10/14/2025
#
# Description: 
# This is a simple script designed to download videos using yt_dlp. The script should
# request a link, then download the video onto the folder in which the script
# is located. Since this is limited to the yt_dlp library, only sites similar to YouTube
# can be downloaded. I plan to mess around and see if I can add additional
# website support in the future.
#
# NOTE: To run this code, you must have yt-dlp installed. You can install this with the
# command: pip install yt-dlp or pip install --user yt-dlp (if permissions is an issue)
